- Interaction Details
  ![img_1.png](images/img_1.png)
    - Both client and server need to have send and receive capabilities
    - Messages can be abstracted into three types: request, response, and notification
    - The architecture can be abstracted into three layers: transport layer, protocol layer, and user layer (server, client)

- Design Principles
    - Protocol layer and transport layer are decoupled through the transport interface
    - Protocol layer contains all MCP protocol-related definitions, including data structures, request construction, and response parsing
    - Both server and client layers have send and receive capabilities. Send capabilities include sending messages (request, response, notification) and matching requests with responses. Receive capabilities include routing messages (request, response, notification) and handling them asynchronously/synchronously
    - Server and client layers implement the combination of requests and responses, presenting as synchronous request, processing, and response from the user's perspective
